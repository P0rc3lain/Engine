# Particle

Techniques that simulate complex physically-based effects.
Particle systems are collections of small images.
When viewed together form a more complex “fuzzy” object, such as fire, smoke, weather, or fireworks.
Controlled by specifying the behavior of individual particles using properties such as initial position, velocity, and lifespan.
